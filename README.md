Implements a secure account deletion feature with multiple security safeguards. Users can delete their accounts through a modal interface that requires additional verification steps. The implementation uses a soft-deletion approach with a 30-day recovery window before permanent deletion. Security measures include password verification, email confirmation, and audit logging of all deletion events.

Key implementations:
- Enhanced `AccountDeletionModal` with multi-step verification
- Added password re-verification before processing deletion
- Implemented email confirmation flow for deletion requests
- Created a deletion queue service with 30-day retention period
- Added audit logging for all deletion-related actions
- Updated JWT strategy to handle restoration of accounts within the recovery window
